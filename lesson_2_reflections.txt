What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
  When you initialize a repository, it does not commit, but creates a .git file to store the meta data. You need to initialize inorder to star commiting and keep track of changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
 Staging area is like a middle ground to decide which files to add in a commit to the repository. This will give a buffer to sort out the files before commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
 We can use staging area to find out what are the logical changes made and then commit after that, so that it acts like a buffer.
